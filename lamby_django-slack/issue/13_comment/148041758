You should be able to reproduce the issue with:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install pip==1.5.4\r\npip uninstall django-slack\r\npip install django-slack\r\n```\r\n\r\nI couldn't find the stats for number of users installing packages with pip 1.5.4 so feel free to close/fix this based on the version of pip you officially support.
