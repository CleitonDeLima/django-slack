I have determined that in whatever value you pass in via the attachments parameter that same value has to be encoded into a JSON string before being sent to Slack's chat.postMessage API.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nimport json\r\n...\r\nif attachments:\r\n    data['attachments'] = json.dumps(attachments)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis seems to make sense. The way I see it, the attachments key/value will send a JSON list containing a JSON dictionary. All other data values can be satisfied with just strings.\r\n\r\nBefore I make another pull request with this change, would it be sensible to ensure the `slack_message` method always JSON encodes the attachments value when present (as exampled above)? \r\n\r\nShould the JSON encoding of the attachments value fall on the developer outside of `slack_message`?", issueCommentId = 140518134}
