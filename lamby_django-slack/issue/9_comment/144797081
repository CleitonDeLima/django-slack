It's helps more than it hurts.\r\n\r\nI gave https://github.com/lamby/django-slack/commit/73a5d8a5d324ea73b64f3a63ebbe93d6ea9d62c7 and it also works. :tada: \r\n\r\nI have now noticed that the return response body varies between the two different url endpoints.\r\n\r\n`chat.postMessage` will return a JSON object in the response body.\r\n`incoming-webhooks` will return only plain text. (i.e. `ok`, `Bad token`)\r\n\r\nThis in turn causes a JSONDecodeError in the `RequestsBackend` class. Specifically on the line:\r\n`result = self.session.post(url, data=data, verify=False).json()`\r\n\r\nIt looks like the post data is working as expected and I am looking at parsing of the response body for both scenarios.\r\n\r\nThoughts?", issueCommentId = 144797081}
