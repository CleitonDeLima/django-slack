Should a endpoint_url of value `None` cause an assertion error when fail_silently is False?\r\n\r\nAssigning the endpoint_url in the template to `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage` would also lead to an undesired result because then endpoint_url is not None and the line `postdata = {'payload': json.dumps(data)}` is executed.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense.", issueCommentId = 144547750}
