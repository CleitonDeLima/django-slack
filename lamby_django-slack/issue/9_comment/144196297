I personally like to keep the integrity of this library functional without introducing fragile logic checks. So, I am honestly drawing a blank on a better solution at the moment.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate all your effort in creating this branch and exploring this feature.\r\n\r\nPossible ideas:\r\n  1.
