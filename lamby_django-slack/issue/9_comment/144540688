This in turn is what is causing the real Python KeyError.\r\n\r\nBy making the `endpoint_url` required, the if check `if endpoint_url is None:` is therefore never true. This results in unintended behavior when distinguishing between API chat.postMessage calls vs incoming webhooks calls.\r\n\r\nThanks for asking the question.", issueCommentId = 144540688}
